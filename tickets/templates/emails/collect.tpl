Dear {{ first_name }}

Your ticket for King's Affair 2017 is now ready for collection!

* Ticket Collection *
Primary ticket holders will be able to come and collect tickets for them and
their guests at the following times in the King's College Bar:

* 11:00am - 1:00pm on Saturday, 10th June
* 9:00 am - 11:00am on Wednesday, 14th June

If you cannot make either of these times, please find someone to collect them

** YOUR TICKETS **
{% for ticket in tickets %}
{{ ticket.first_name }} {{ ticket.last_name }}{% if not ticket.parent %}: (Primary Ticket){% endif %}
{% endfor %}

* Name Changes *

Name changes to guest tickets (of King's members) are still available, and
cost Â£30. Name changes to primary tickets can only be done in exceptional
circumstances. If you would like a primary name change, please email the 
new crsid and name to ticketing@kingsaffair.com.

If you have requested a name change since last Thursday, these will be processed
on Thursday evening (if they haven't been already), and will not be reflected
on the physical tickets. Additionally, if you are the recipient of a primary
name change that has been processed since last Thursday, your ticket will have
the previous ticket holder's name on it, so please remember that when you come to
collect your ticket.

Information about ticket collection will be released soon over our Facebook page
https://www.facebook.com/thekingsaffair.


Thanks,
The King's Affair Committee :)
